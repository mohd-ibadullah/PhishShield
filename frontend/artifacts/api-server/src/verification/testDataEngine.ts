You can verify your current payment method or choose to add another payment method at the following page:\n\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentmethods\n\nSome common reasons why an authorization might fail are:\n\n* Your bank may decline authorizations if the CVV2 security code was not requested. Your bank may be able to temporarily lift this requirement.\n\n* The authorization is for a low dollar amount ($1.00) which your bank may decline.\n\n* If you signed up for multiple AWS services, a $1.00 authorization may be performed for each service. Your bank may approve the first authorization and decline subsequent ones depending on their security policies.\n\n* Some banks have restrictions on Internet transactions. You may want to check with your credit card company to see if they have such a restriction.\n\nWe recommend you contact your bank to determine the exact reason for the decline, or to ask them to take steps on their end to approve the authorization. Once your bank is ready to approve the authorization, please contact us back and we will retry this authorization for you.\n\nhttps://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/html-forms-controller/contactus/aws-account-and-billing\n\nYou can contact AWS Customer Service via the Support Center: https://aws.amazon.com/support\n\nIf you feel you have received this e-mail in error, please include these details in your case.\n\nThank you for using Amazon Web Services.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAmazon Web Services",
