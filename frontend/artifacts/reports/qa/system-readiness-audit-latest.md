## Final verdict

**SYSTEM VERIFIED (APR 2026 RUN): internal suite PASS**

> This audit reflects an **internal readiness suite** (synthetic + curated “real-world” samples) from April 2026.
> In May 2026 we ran **100 real emails through the live UI** and found **20 issues** (score↔verdict mismatch, non‑Latin false negatives, unicode obfuscation, scam families missed, and multiple false positives). All 20 were fixed and re‑verified via FastAPI on `127.0.0.1:8000` with **20/20 PASS**.

## QA Testing & Hardening (May 2026)

- **What changed**: The system moved from “offline/curated suite looks perfect” to “live UI traffic reveals gaps”.
- **Live QA**: 100 real emails scanned in the UI (May 2026).
- **Fixes**: 20 critical/behavioral bugs found and fixed (see `MASTER_GUIDE.md` and `docs/PHISHSHIELD_COMPLETE_OVERVIEW.md`).
- **Honest accuracy note**:
  - Offline benchmark (training split): ~97% (see `backend/training_meta.json`)
  - Live UI accuracy (May 2026): ~80–85% (real emails, broader distribution)
