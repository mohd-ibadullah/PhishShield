# PhishShield AI — Final PPT Script

This file is the copy-ready speaking flow for the deck.

---

## Slide 1 — Title

**PhishShield AI**  
**Explainable Phishing Defense**

**Subtitle:** Detect. Explain. Protect.

### Say
> PhishShield AI is a full-stack phishing defense project that helps users understand scam risk before they click, reply, or share sensitive information.

---

## Slide 2 — The problem

### Title
**Phishing is still hard for users to judge in real time**

### Put on slide
- scams often imitate banks, delivery services, and government workflows
- urgency and impersonation make risky messages look believable
- many tools warn the user but do not explain the threat clearly

### Say
> The challenge is not only detection accuracy. It is giving the user clarity at the exact moment they must decide whether to trust the message.

---

## Slide 3 — The gap

### Title
**Existing tools are often generic and opaque**

### Put on slide
- limited user-facing explanation
- weak support for multilingual phishing
- poor coverage of India-focused scam patterns
- little integration into the browser experience

### Say
> We wanted to build something more interpretable, more contextual, and more practical for real phishing behavior.

---

## Slide 4 — The solution

### Title
**Introducing PhishShield AI**

### Put on slide
- explainable phishing detection
- multilingual analysis
- India-specific scam coverage
- dashboard + backend + Chrome extension

### Say
> PhishShield does not just say “risky.” It shows the score, the category, and the strongest reasons behind the verdict.

---

## Slide 5 — How it works

### Title
**Hybrid detection pipeline**

### Put on slide
- rule-based cues for OTP, UPI, KYC, Aadhaar, PAN, GST, and bank scams
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression fallback scoring
- SecureBERT/MuRIL for deeper semantic analysis
- link, domain, and spoofing checks
- explanation layer for human-readable output

### Say
> This gives the system both speed and semantic depth, while keeping the output understandable.

---

## Slide 6 — Why it is different

### Title
**Why PhishShield stands out**

### Put on slide
- explainable AI, not a black box
- India-focused phishing intelligence
- English + Hindi + Telugu coverage
- browser and Gmail warning surface
- feedback loop for improvement

### Say
> The strength of the project is the combination of detection logic, user trust, and a real product experience.

---

## Slide 7 — Demo and proof

### Title
**Live scan + stored verification evidence**

### Put on slide
- Accuracy: `97.19%`
- Precision: `94.05%`
- Recall: `99.11%`
- F1 Score: `96.52%`
- Dataset rows: `18,684`
- Live UI QA (May 2026, 100 real emails): `~80–85%` accuracy after hardening (was `~42%` before)
- April 2026 stored artifacts: internal suites PASS (not a live-accuracy claim)

### Say
> The repo includes both the live demo surface and stored QA evidence, which makes the project stronger than a model-only prototype.

---

## Slide 8 — Impact and close

### Title
**From detection to trust**

### Put on slide
- helps users recognize scams before acting
- can extend to consumer and institutional security workflows
- future scope: hosted deployment, broader language support, deeper threat intelligence

### Final line
> PhishShield turns phishing detection from a black-box alert into a clear, actionable security experience.
