# PhishShield AI — Showcase & Judge Pitch Pack

Use this file for demos, interviews, portfolio reviews, and final presentations.

---

## 1) One-line positioning

> **PhishShield AI is an explainable phishing defense project built for India-focused scam patterns, multilingual email abuse, and browser-side warnings.**

---

## 2) What is actually in the project

- **React dashboard** for email scanning, verdicts, history, and model-health UI
- **TypeScript API + verification tooling** for project-side analysis and QA workflows
- **FastAPI backend** with TF-IDF + SecureBERT/MuRIL-based phishing analysis
- **`PhishShield Guardian` Chrome extension** for risky sites and Gmail content

---

## 3) Why it stands out

`PhishShield` is stronger than a simple phishing classifier because it:

- explains **why** a message or destination looks dangerous
- targets **India-specific scams** such as OTP, UPI, KYC, Aadhaar, PAN, GST, refund, and bank impersonation fraud
- identifies advanced threats like **Thread Hijacking**, **Malicious Attachments**, and **QR Code Evasion**
- supports **English, Hindi, Telugu, and mixed-script phishing**
- works across a **dashboard + backend + extension**, not just one model endpoint
- already includes **stored QA and benchmark artifacts** in the repo

---

## 4) Numbers to show

- **Offline benchmark accuracy (training split):** `97.19%`
- **Precision:** `94.05%`
- **Recall:** `99.11%`
- **F1 Score:** `96.52%`
- **Dataset rows:** `18,684`
- **Live UI QA accuracy (May 2026, 100 real emails):** ~80–85% after hardening (was ~42% before fixes)
- **Stored April 2026 artifacts:** internal suites PASS (do not present as “perfect live accuracy”)

---

## 5) 30-second pitch

> PhishShield AI helps users understand phishing risk before they act. It combines explainable AI, India-specific scam detection, multilingual analysis, and browser-side warnings so the output is not just a label, but a usable security decision.

---

## 6) 90-second demo flow

1. open the dashboard
2. paste a phishing email or pick a strong scenario
3. click **Analyze Email**
4. point to:
   - risk score
   - final verdict
   - attack category
   - top reasons / signals
5. show a safe email for contrast
6. optionally open the extension popup or warning view

### Line to say
> “The important part is that the user can immediately see the reason behind the verdict, not just a black-box warning.”

---

## 7) Slide order for a clean deck

1. **Problem** — phishing is rising and users still struggle to judge trust quickly
2. **Gap** — many tools are generic and hard to interpret
3. **Solution** — PhishShield AI
4. **Architecture** — dashboard + API + FastAPI backend + extension
5. **Why it is different** — explainability, multilingual support, India-specific rules
6. **Demo** — one phishing scan + one safe scan
7. **Proof** — metrics, audit report, and benchmark artifacts
8. **Impact / next step** — where it can go from here

---

## 8) Judge questions and sharp answers

### Q1. What is the novelty here?
**Answer:**
> The project combines explainable AI, advanced threat analysis (Thread Hijacking/Attachments), multilingual phishing analysis, India-specific fraud coverage, and browser-side warnings in one user flow.

### Q2. Why not rely on a generic spam filter?
**Answer:**
> Generic filters are often opaque and not tuned for the specific scam patterns this project targets. PhishShield focuses on phishing risk and user-facing explanation.

### Q3. Is this only a model demo?
**Answer:**
> No. It includes a working dashboard, a browser extension, a FastAPI backend, validation scripts, and stored QA evidence in the repo.

### Q4. How do you prove it works?
**Answer:**
> The repository includes model metrics, a system-readiness audit, benchmark reports, and live validation scripts for local reproduction.
